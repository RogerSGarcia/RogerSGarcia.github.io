	<h1> Welcome to Rogersville ! </h1>

	<p>
		This is Roger Garcia's website, dedicated to sharing educational information on a range of subjects, including but not limited to: Linux, Python, Blockchain, Machine Learning (RL), Trading (Crypto) and being a Peruvian Vegan. <strong>why?</strong> I'm passionate about these topics, it continues to play a role in my personal growth and have found it immensely rewarding when you come across people that enjoy the same things your looking into. So, that's all folks! <a href="/about"> Read more on this Peruvian Vegan...</a><br>

		The creation of this website is inspired by [Jonathan McGlone](jmcglone.com)'s demo on GitHub Pages and Jekyll. A work in progress.
