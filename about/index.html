	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		Hi !, first and foremost, thanks for taking an interest in who I am. Roger (a.k.a junior) was born on St.Patrick's Day in New Jersey to the most loving, supportive and inspiring Peruvian mother. My research work to date has allowed me to find a fascinating field in Artificial Intelligence (AI). I am interested in problems related to machine learning, game theory and reinforcement learning. As a result, I look to improving my understanding of teaching and learning in order to make contributions.
